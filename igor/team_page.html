        <p class="description">Our team consists of air guitarists who are so talented,
            that they can even play the guitars in the air! No strings,
            no problem!<br> We are the only ones who have taken the art of air guitar to the next level.
            In fact, we can claim to be the only music academy without instruments!<br>
            Our team is made up of rock stars who play their air guitars so masterfully
            that they make the air itself rock. This makes us
            the only team that can claim to have defeated gravity!</p>
